# Defect Classification Taxonomy

A standardised hierarchy for classifying quality defects. Customise categories and subcategories to match your product and process.

## 1. Dimensional

Defects related to physical measurements outside specification.

| Subcategory | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| out-of-tolerance | Measured dimension outside specified limits |
| warpage | Distortion or bending beyond acceptable limits |
| misalignment | Components not properly aligned |
| incorrect-size | Wrong overall dimensions |

## 2. Surface Finish

Defects affecting the surface quality of the product.

| Subcategory | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| surface-roughness | Surface finish exceeds Ra specification |
| scratches | Visible scratch marks on finished surface |
| dents | Indentations or depressions in surface |
| discolouration | Colour variation or staining |
| burrs | Unwanted raised edges or material |

## 3. Contamination

Foreign material or substance affecting product quality.

| Subcategory | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| particulate | Foreign particles embedded or adhered |
| chemical | Chemical residue or contamination |
| biological | Mould, bacteria, or organic contamination |
| cross-contamination | Material from another product or process |

## 4. Assembly

Defects occurring during product assembly.

| Subcategory | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| missing-component | Required component not installed |
| wrong-component | Incorrect component installed |
| incorrect-torque | Fastener torque outside specification |
| misassembly | Components assembled in wrong order or orientation |
| interference | Components physically interfering |

## 5. Material

Defects inherent in raw materials or components.

| Subcategory | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| wrong-material | Incorrect material grade or type |
| material-defect | Cracks, voids, inclusions in raw material |
| out-of-spec | Material properties outside specification |
| degradation | Material deteriorated (age, storage, exposure) |

## 6. Functional

Defects affecting product function or performance.

| Subcategory | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| performance-failure | Does not meet performance specification |
| intermittent-fault | Inconsistent or intermittent failure |
| complete-failure | Product non-functional |
| reduced-life | Expected service life below specification |

## 7. Cosmetic

Visual defects not affecting function.

| Subcategory | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| paint-defect | Runs, sags, orange peel, colour mismatch |
| marking-error | Incorrect or missing labels, markings, engravings |
| packaging-damage | Damage from packaging or handling |
| finish-inconsistency | Variation in visual finish between units |

## 8. Documentation

Defects in associated documentation or labelling.

| Subcategory | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| missing-documentation | Required documents not provided |
| incorrect-labelling | Wrong information on labels or markings |
| traceability-gap | Break in batch/lot traceability chain |
| certificate-error | Incorrect or missing quality certificates |

## Usage

When classifying a defect:
1. Select the **category** (top level, e.g. "dimensional")
2. Select the **subcategory** (specific type, e.g. "out-of-tolerance")
3. If no subcategory fits, use the category alone and describe in free text
4. A single defect should have exactly one category; if multiple apply, choose the primary
