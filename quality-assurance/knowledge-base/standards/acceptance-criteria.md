# Quality Acceptance Criteria

Standard acceptance criteria for quality inspection. Customise thresholds and limits to match your product specifications.

## Inspection Levels

### Level 1 — Visual Inspection
- No visible defects on A-surfaces (customer-facing)
- Minor cosmetic defects acceptable on B-surfaces (hidden) per agreed limit
- All labels present, legible, and correctly positioned

### Level 2 — Dimensional Inspection
- All critical dimensions within specified tolerance
- Non-critical dimensions within ±2× tolerance (unless otherwise specified)
- Surface finish within Ra specification

### Level 3 — Functional Testing
- Product meets all performance specifications
- Pass/fail criteria per test procedure
- All safety-critical functions verified

## Sampling Plans

| Lot Size | Sample Size (Normal) | Accept | Reject |
|----------|---------------------|--------|--------|
| 2-8 | 2 | 0 | 1 |
| 9-15 | 3 | 0 | 1 |
| 16-25 | 5 | 0 | 1 |
| 26-50 | 8 | 1 | 2 |
| 51-90 | 13 | 1 | 2 |
| 91-150 | 20 | 2 | 3 |
| 151-280 | 32 | 3 | 4 |
| 281-500 | 50 | 5 | 6 |

Based on ISO 2859-1 / AQL 1.0, General Inspection Level II.

## Severity-Based Disposition

| Severity | Disposition Options |
|----------|-------------------|
| Critical | Quarantine → MRB review → scrap or rework with 100% re-inspection |
| Major | Hold → engineering review → rework, use-as-is with concession, or scrap |
| Minor | Use-as-is (if within concession limits) or rework at next opportunity |
| Observation | Log for trend monitoring, no immediate action required |

## Supplier Acceptance

- First article inspection (FAI) required for new suppliers and new parts
- Incoming inspection per sampling plan above
- Supplier quality score must remain above 85% for continued approval
- Below 70% triggers corrective action request (CAR)
- Below 50% triggers supplier review and potential disqualification

## Concession Process

When product does not meet specification but may be fit for use:
1. Engineering review of deviation
2. Risk assessment (safety, function, reliability)
3. Customer notification (if contractually required)
4. Documented concession approval with expiry
5. Root cause analysis to prevent recurrence
