## Usage Notes

- These are standard starting points — the specific warranties required will depend on the findings of due diligence
- Red-rated risks typically warrant specific indemnities rather than general warranties
- Amber-rated risks may be addressed through enhanced warranties with lower disclosure thresholds
- Consider warranty limitations: time limits, financial caps, de minimis thresholds, and disclosure qualifications
- Tax warranties and indemnities are typically dealt with in a separate tax deed
