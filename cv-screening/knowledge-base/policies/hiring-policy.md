# Hiring Policy & Bias Mitigation Guidelines

## Principles

1. **Merit-based assessment**: All candidates are evaluated solely on their skills, experience, qualifications, and demonstrated ability.
2. **Equal opportunity**: We do not discriminate on the basis of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage/civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, race, religion/belief, sex, or sexual orientation (Equality Act 2010 protected characteristics).
3. **Reasonable adjustments**: We accommodate candidates who need adjustments during the recruitment process.

## Bias Mitigation

### What We Anonymise
- Candidate names
- Dates of birth and age indicators
- Gender and pronouns
- Photographs
- Addresses (country retained for work authorisation)
- Email addresses and phone numbers

### What We Do NOT Penalise
- **Employment gaps**: Career breaks for any reason (caring responsibilities, health, travel, study, redundancy) are not negative factors.
- **Non-traditional paths**: Career changers, self-taught professionals, and non-degree holders are evaluated on demonstrated ability.
- **Part-time or contract work**: Assessed on the quality and relevance of experience, not employment type.
- **International experience**: Qualifications and experience from any country are valued equally.

### Red Flag Handling
Red flags (employment gaps, frequent role changes, etc.) are noted for discussion, never for automatic disqualification. The interviewer should explore these neutrally.

## Scoring Guidelines

- Use structured, consistent criteria for all candidates in a batch
- Document reasoning for every score
- If in doubt about whether an assessment factor is biased, err on the side of excluding it
- Review shortlists for demographic patterns — if the shortlist lacks diversity, review the criteria rather than adjusting individual scores

## Compliance

- All screening decisions must be auditable
- Retain pipeline outputs for 12 months minimum
- Candidates may request feedback on their application under GDPR (subject access request)
- Data retention: CV data deleted 6 months after role is filled unless candidate consents to longer retention

## Interview Stage

- Use structured interview questions (same core questions for all candidates)
- Supplement with candidate-specific questions based on gaps identified in screening
- Score interview responses against a predefined rubric
- Minimum two interviewers for each candidate
