# Standard Clause Playbook — UK Commercial Contracts

This playbook defines the standard position for key clauses in UK commercial contracts. The risk assessor uses this as the baseline for evaluating deviations.

## Term and Duration

**Standard:** Fixed initial term of 12–36 months with automatic renewal unless either party gives 90 days' written notice before expiry.

**Key points:**
- Avoid rolling contracts with no fixed term
- Renewal notice period should be at least 60 days
- Ensure commencement date is clearly stated
- Watch for evergreen clauses with onerous exit terms

## Termination

**Standard:**
- Termination for convenience: either party, 90 days' written notice
- Termination for cause: 30 days' written notice to cure, immediate if not remedied
- Immediate termination: insolvency, material breach incapable of remedy

**Key points:**
- Both parties should have equivalent termination rights
- Notice periods below 60 days for convenience are below market
- Ensure consequences of termination are clearly stated (wind-down, data return)
- Watch for termination fees or liquidated damages on early exit

## Limitation of Liability

**Standard:** Total aggregate liability capped at 150% of annual contract value (or total charges in the preceding 12-month period, whichever is greater).

**Key points:**
- Uncapped liability is a red flag
- Caps below 100% of annual value are below market
- Standard carve-outs from the cap: death/personal injury, fraud, wilful default, confidentiality breach, IP infringement indemnity
- Indirect/consequential loss exclusions should be mutual
- Ensure the cap applies to both parties

## Indemnity

**Standard:** Mutual indemnity for third-party claims arising from breach of the agreement, IP infringement, and negligence. Indemnity obligations subject to the liability cap.

**Key points:**
- One-sided indemnity is a red flag
- Uncapped indemnity is a red flag
- Indemnity should be subject to the overall liability cap (with limited carve-outs)
- Ensure indemnifying party has right to control the defence
- Watch for broad "hold harmless" language without limitation

## Intellectual Property

**Standard:** Each party retains ownership of its pre-existing IP. New IP created specifically for the engagement is owned by the commissioning party, with a licence back to the creator for non-competing uses.

**Key points:**
- Blanket IP assignment of all work product is aggressive — negotiate
- Ensure pre-existing IP is protected with clear definitions
- Background IP should remain with the originating party
- Licence terms should survive termination
- Watch for "work made for hire" language (US concept, not UK)

## Confidentiality

**Standard:** Mutual confidentiality obligations. Confidential information defined by marking or by nature. Obligations survive for 3 years after termination. Standard exceptions: public domain, independently developed, required by law.

**Key points:**
- Duration beyond 3 years is above market for most commercial contracts
- Ensure exceptions are comprehensive
- Watch for overly broad definitions of confidential information
- Residual knowledge clauses are acceptable
- Consider carve-outs for professional advisers

## Payment Terms

**Standard:** Invoices payable within 30 days of receipt. Late payment interest at 4% above Bank of England base rate (or statutory rate under Late Payment of Commercial Debts Act 1998).

**Key points:**
- Payment terms beyond 60 days are below market
- Ensure right to charge interest on late payments
- Watch for "pay when paid" clauses (often unenforceable)
- Set-off rights should be mutual and clearly defined
- Milestone-based payments should have clear acceptance criteria

## Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

**Standard:** Governed by the laws of England and Wales. Disputes subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.

**Key points:**
- Foreign governing law requires specialist review
- Arbitration clauses should specify: seat, rules (e.g. LCIA, ICC), number of arbitrators, language
- Mediation as a pre-condition to litigation is reasonable
- Watch for exclusive jurisdiction in counterparty's home jurisdiction
- Consider enforcement implications for international contracts

## Force Majeure

**Standard:** Neither party liable for failure to perform due to events beyond reasonable control. Affected party must notify promptly and mitigate. Either party may terminate if force majeure continues beyond 90 days.

**Key points:**
- Ensure the definition is appropriately broad (but not catch-all)
- Pandemic/epidemic should be explicitly addressed post-COVID
- Payment obligations should typically not be excused by force majeure
- Termination right after prolonged force majeure is standard

## Data Protection

**Standard:** Compliance with UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018. Data processing agreement where personal data is processed. Appropriate technical and organisational measures.

**Key points:**
- Must identify controller/processor roles
- International transfers require appropriate safeguards
- Data processing agreement required if personal data is shared
- Ensure data return/deletion on termination
- Watch for broad data use rights beyond the contract scope

## Warranties

**Standard:** Mutual representations that each party has authority to enter the agreement. Service provider warrants services will be performed with reasonable skill and care (consistent with Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982).

**Key points:**
- "As is" or disclaimer of all warranties is aggressive
- Fitness for purpose warranties may be appropriate for bespoke solutions
- Watch for warranty periods that are unreasonably short
- Ensure remedies for breach of warranty are proportionate

## Assignment

**Standard:** Neither party may assign without prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld). Permitted assignment to affiliates or successors on notice.

**Key points:**
- Unrestricted assignment rights for one party only is below market
- Change of control provisions should be considered
- Novation vs assignment — ensure the distinction is clear

## Entire Agreement

**Standard:** The agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties. No variation except in writing signed by both parties.

**Key points:**
- Ensure pre-contractual representations are not inadvertently excluded
- Amendment provisions should require written agreement from both parties
- Watch for clauses that allow unilateral variation (e.g. "by updating our website")

## Notices

**Standard:** All notices in writing, delivered by hand, recorded delivery, or email to specified addresses. Deemed received: hand delivery — on delivery; post — 2 business days after posting; email — on confirmed receipt.

**Key points:**
- Ensure notice addresses are specified in the agreement
- Email-only notice may not be sufficient for termination notices
- Watch for deemed receipt provisions that are unreasonably short

## Insurance

**Standard:** Service provider maintains professional indemnity insurance of not less than £2,000,000 per claim, public liability insurance of not less than £5,000,000, and employer's liability insurance as required by law.

**Key points:**
- Insurance levels should be proportionate to contract value and risk
- Ensure obligation to maintain insurance for duration of the contract plus a reasonable tail
- Request evidence of insurance on reasonable notice

## Non-Solicitation

**Standard:** Neither party shall solicit or entice away employees of the other party during the term and for 12 months after termination.

**Key points:**
- Duration beyond 12 months may be unenforceable
- Ensure the restriction is mutual
- Consider carve-outs for general recruitment advertising
- Non-compete clauses require careful review for enforceability
