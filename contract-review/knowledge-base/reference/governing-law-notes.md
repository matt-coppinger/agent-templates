# Governing Law and Jurisdiction — Reference Notes

## England and Wales (Default)

- Most common choice for UK commercial contracts
- Well-established commercial law, extensive case law
- Courts of England and Wales are internationally respected for commercial disputes
- London is a major centre for international arbitration (LCIA)
- Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and Consumer Rights Act 2015 apply
- Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 for payment disputes

## Scotland

- Separate legal system from England and Wales
- Different rules on prescription (limitation periods)
- Scots law has distinct concepts: e.g. "jus quaesitum tertio" (third-party rights)
- Court of Session (Edinburgh) for significant commercial matters
- Consider if parties or performance are based in Scotland

## Northern Ireland

- Largely mirrors English law but with some differences
- Separate court system

## International Considerations

### EU Jurisdictions (Post-Brexit)
- UK is no longer subject to Brussels I Regulation for jurisdiction/enforcement
- Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements (2005) applies
- Consider enforcement of English judgments in EU member states
- Rome I Regulation no longer applies — choice of law governed by retained EU law

### United States
- Federal vs state law distinction — always specify the state
- Significant differences from English law: discovery obligations, jury trials, punitive damages
- "Work made for hire" doctrine — not applicable in UK
- Class action exposure
- Enforcement of US judgments in UK requires common law action

### Arbitration vs Litigation

**Arbitration advantages:**
- Confidentiality
- Choice of arbitrator with specialist expertise
- Potentially faster for complex disputes
- Easier international enforcement (New York Convention)

**Arbitration disadvantages:**
- Can be more expensive than court proceedings
- Limited appeal rights
- No interim relief without court assistance (unless institutional rules provide)

**Common arbitral institutions:**
- LCIA (London Court of International Arbitration) — UK-seated
- ICC (International Chamber of Commerce) — Paris-based, international
- SIAC (Singapore International Arbitration Centre) — Asia-Pacific

### Key Questions for Jurisdiction Review

1. Where are the parties incorporated/based?
2. Where will the contract be performed?
3. Where are the assets that might need to be enforced against?
4. Is there a regulatory framework that mandates a particular jurisdiction?
5. What is the value of the contract (proportionality of dispute resolution costs)?
6. Are there related agreements with different governing law?
7. Will judgments/awards need to be enforced internationally?

## Limitation Periods

| Jurisdiction | Contract Claims | Tort Claims |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| England & Wales | 6 years (12 years if by deed) | 6 years |
| Scotland | 5 years | 5 years |
| Northern Ireland | 6 years (12 years if by deed) | 6 years |

## Regulatory Considerations

- **Financial services:** FCA regulation may impose specific requirements
- **Data protection:** UK GDPR applies regardless of governing law if UK data subjects are involved
- **Employment:** Employment law of the jurisdiction where the employee works typically applies
- **Consumer contracts:** Consumer protection legislation may override choice of law
- **Competition law:** UK Competition Act 1998 applies to anti-competitive agreements affecting UK markets
