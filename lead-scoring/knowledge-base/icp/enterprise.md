# Ideal Customer Profile — Enterprise

## Definition

Enterprise accounts are organisations with 500+ employees and typically $50M+ in annual revenue. These are high-value, complex sales requiring multi-threaded engagement.

## Firmographic Criteria

| Attribute | Ideal | Acceptable |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Employees | 1,000+ | 500–999 |
| Annual Revenue | $100M+ | $50M–$100M |
| Geography | UK, US, EU, ANZ | Global (English-speaking) |
| Industry | Logistics, Financial Services, Manufacturing, Healthcare | Any B2B with complex workflows |

## Buying Signals

- Multiple stakeholders involved (C-suite sponsorship required)
- Existing legacy systems they want to replace
- Compliance or regulatory driver
- Digital transformation initiative underway
- Budget cycle alignment (typically annual planning)

## Technology Indicators

- SAP, Oracle, or Salesforce in their stack
- Existing automation tools they've outgrown (Zapier, Make, Power Automate)
- Custom internal tools they want to replace
- API-first infrastructure

## Decision Process

- **Timeline**: 3–6 months from first contact to close
- **Decision makers**: CTO, VP Operations, Head of IT, CFO (for budget)
- **Procurement**: formal RFP process common
- **Proof of concept**: almost always required

## Red Flags

- No clear budget or timeline
- Single contact with no authority
- "Just researching" with no stated business need
- Company in financial distress (recent layoffs, restructuring)
