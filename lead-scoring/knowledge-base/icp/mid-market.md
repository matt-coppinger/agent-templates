# Ideal Customer Profile — Mid-Market

## Definition

Mid-market accounts are organisations with 50–499 employees and typically $5M–$50M in annual revenue. These represent the highest volume of quality opportunities with shorter sales cycles than enterprise.

## Firmographic Criteria

| Attribute | Ideal | Acceptable |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Employees | 100–499 | 50–99 |
| Annual Revenue | $10M–$50M | $5M–$10M |
| Geography | UK, US, EU | Global (English-speaking) |
| Industry | SaaS, Professional Services, E-commerce, Logistics | Any B2B with growth trajectory |

## Buying Signals

- Growing pains — manual processes breaking at scale
- Recently raised funding or hit revenue milestone
- Hiring for operations/IT roles (scaling signal)
- Single decision-maker or small buying committee
- Actively comparing solutions

## Technology Indicators

- Using entry-level automation (Zapier, Make) and hitting limits
- Google Workspace or Microsoft 365
- Modern SaaS stack (Slack, HubSpot, Notion)
- Some custom integrations needed

## Decision Process

- **Timeline**: 1–3 months from first contact to close
- **Decision makers**: CEO/Founder, Head of Ops, CTO
- **Procurement**: informal, often founder-led
- **Proof of concept**: demo + trial usually sufficient

## Red Flags

- No clear pain point beyond "exploring options"
- Personal email address for primary contact
- Company website looks inactive or under construction
- Unrealistic expectations for budget vs scope
