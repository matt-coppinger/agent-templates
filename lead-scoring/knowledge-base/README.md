# Knowledge Base

Add your company documentation here as markdown files. Organise by topic:

```
knowledge-base/
  icp/
    enterprise.md
    mid-market.md
    smb.md
  scoring/
    scoring-model.md
    disqualification-criteria.md
  competitors/
    competitor-a.md
    competitor-b.md
  case-studies/
    logistics-industry.md
    financial-services.md
```

The Enricher and Scorer sub-agents search this directory for relevant content. Plain markdown works best — keep files focused on single topics for better retrieval.
