# KPI Definitions and Formulas

Standard financial KPI definitions used throughout the pipeline.

## Primary KPIs

### Revenue

- **Purpose**: Cash available for dividends, debt repayment, or investment

### Headcount

## Variance Interpretation Guide

| KPI Type | Positive Variance | Negative Variance |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Revenue | Favourable (above plan) | Unfavourable (below plan) |
| COGS | Unfavourable (over budget) | Favourable (under budget) |
| Gross Margin | Favourable | Unfavourable |
| OPEX | Unfavourable (over budget) | Favourable (under budget) |
| EBITDA | Favourable | Unfavourable |
| Net Profit | Favourable | Unfavourable |

**Key rule**: For revenue/profit items, higher = better. For cost items, lower = better. Always state whether a variance is favourable or unfavourable — the sign alone is ambiguous.
