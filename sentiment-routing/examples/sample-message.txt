Subject: COMPLETELY FED UP - CANCELLING MY ACCOUNT

To whom it may concern,

I am ABSOLUTELY FURIOUS. This is now the FOURTH time I've had to contact you about the same issue — my invoices keep showing charges for a premium add-on I cancelled back in November. Every single time I'm told "it's been resolved" and every single month it appears again on my bill.

I've been a loyal customer for over 4 years and I spend nearly £15,000 a year with you. This is how you treat your long-standing customers? I've already started looking at what your competitors offer and frankly several of them look considerably better value.

If this isn't resolved PERMANENTLY within the next 48 hours, I will be:
1. Cancelling my entire account
2. Filing a complaint with Trading Standards
3. Leaving reviews on every platform I can find

I want a full refund of every incorrect charge since November (that's 3 months × £89 = £267) and I want written confirmation that this will NEVER happen again.

My account number is ENT-00482.
