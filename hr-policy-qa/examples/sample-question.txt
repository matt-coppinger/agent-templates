Subject: Annual leave carryover question

Hi HR,

I've got about 8 days of annual leave left this year and I'm not going to be able to use them all before December. I've been here for 3 years so I think I get 27 days but I just couldn't fit them all in this year because of the project deadlines in Q4.

Is there any way I can carry some of these days over to next year? And if so, how many can I carry over and what do I need to do?

Thanks,
Alex
