# Sick Leave Policy

**Policy reference:** HR-POL-002
**Effective date:** 1 January 2026
**Review date:** 1 January 2027

## Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)

Under UK law, employees are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) if they:
- Are off sick for 4 or more consecutive days (including non-working days)
- Earn at least £123 per week (2025/26 rate)
- Have notified their employer within the required timeframe

SSP is paid at **£116.75 per week** (2025/26 rate) for up to 28 weeks.

## Company Sick Pay

The company provides enhanced sick pay above the statutory minimum:

| Length of Service | Full Pay | Half Pay |
|---|---|---|
| 0–6 months | SSP only | SSP only |
| 6 months–2 years | 2 weeks | 2 weeks |
| 2–5 years | 4 weeks | 4 weeks |
| 5+ years | 8 weeks | 8 weeks |

Company sick pay is inclusive of SSP (not in addition to it).

## Notification

- Notify your line manager as early as possible on the first day of absence, and no later than 30 minutes after your normal start time
- Provide a brief reason for the absence
- Keep your manager updated if the absence extends beyond the original estimate

## Evidence

- **1–7 calendar days:** self-certification form (available on the HR portal)
- **8+ calendar days:** a fit note (Statement of Fitness for Work) from your GP is required

## Return to Work

- A return-to-work meeting with your line manager is required after every period of sickness absence
- For absences of 4+ weeks, a phased return may be arranged with Occupational Health support

## Absence Triggers

The company monitors sickness absence patterns. A review meeting may be triggered by:
- 3 or more separate periods of absence in a rolling 12-month period
- A single absence of 10+ consecutive working days
- A pattern of absence (e.g. frequent Mondays/Fridays)

Trigger meetings are supportive, not disciplinary, and aim to identify any underlying issues or reasonable adjustments.

## Long-Term Sickness

For absences exceeding 4 weeks, the company will:
- Maintain regular contact with the employee
- Arrange an Occupational Health referral if appropriate
- Consider reasonable adjustments to facilitate a return to work
- Follow a fair process in line with the Equality Act 2010 if the condition may be a disability
