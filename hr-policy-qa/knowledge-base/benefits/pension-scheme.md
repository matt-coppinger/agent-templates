**Policy reference:** HR-BEN-001
**Effective date:** 1 January 2026
**Review date:** 1 January 2027

## Auto-Enrolment

Under the Pensions Act 2008, the company automatically enrols all eligible employees into the workplace pension scheme. You are eligible if you:
- Are aged between 22 and State Pension age
- Earn above £10,000 per year
- Work in the UK

## Contributions

| | Minimum (statutory) | Company Scheme |
|---|---|---|
| **Employee contribution** | 5% (incl. tax relief) | 5% of qualifying earnings |
| **Employer contribution** | 3% | **8%** of qualifying earnings |

Qualifying earnings are your gross salary between £6,240 and £50,270 per year (2025/26 thresholds).

Employees may increase their personal contributions above 5% via the HR portal. The employer contribution remains at 8% regardless.

## Salary Sacrifice

The company offers a salary sacrifice arrangement for pension contributions, which can save both employer and employee National Insurance. Contact the Payroll team for details.

## Pension Provider

The company pension is managed by **Scottish Widows**. You can access your pension account, view your pot, and manage investments at [scottishwidows.co.uk](https://www.scottishwidows.co.uk).

## Opting Out

You have the right to opt out of the pension scheme within 1 month of enrolment. If you opt out, you will receive a refund of any contributions already made. The company is required to re-enrol opted-out employees every 3 years.

## Tax Relief

Pension contributions attract tax relief at your marginal rate:
- **Basic rate (20%):** relief applied automatically
- **Higher rate (40%):** claim additional relief through your self-assessment tax return
- **Additional rate (45%):** claim additional relief through your self-assessment tax return

## Death in Service
