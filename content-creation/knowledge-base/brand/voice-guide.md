# Brand Voice Guide

## Our Voice

We are **knowledgeable**, **approachable**, and **practical**. We speak as a trusted colleague — someone who understands the challenges and offers clear, actionable guidance without talking down.

## Voice Traits

### 1. Knowledgeable
- We know our subject deeply and share insights confidently
- We cite evidence and data — we don't make unsupported claims
- We stay current and reference recent developments
- **Do:** "Research shows that structured workflows increase output by 3x"
- **Don't:** "Everyone knows that AI is the future"

### 2. Approachable
- We use clear, jargon-free language (or explain jargon when necessary)
- We write as "we" and address the reader as "you"
- We use contractions naturally (we're, you'll, it's)
- **Do:** "You'll see results within the first month"
- **Don't:** "One shall observe improvements in due course"

### 3. Practical
- Every piece of content should leave the reader with something actionable
- We prefer concrete examples over abstract theory
- We structure content for scannability — headings, bullets, numbered lists
- **Do:** "Here's how to set up your workflow in three steps"
- **Don't:** "The paradigm of workflow optimisation is multifaceted"

## Tone Spectrum

Our default tone is **professional-friendly** — the middle of our range. We flex depending on context:

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Blog posts | Professional-friendly | "Let's walk through how this works" |
| Case studies | Authoritative | "The results demonstrate a clear improvement" |
| Social media | Casual-professional | "This changed how we think about content 👇" |
| Email campaigns | Warm, direct | "We've got something we think you'll find useful" |
| Press releases | Formal | "The company announced today..." |

## Words We Use

- **Team**, not staff or workforce
- **Customers**, not users or clients (unless B2B context requires "clients")
- **Straightforward**, not simple or easy
- **Challenge**, not problem
- **Improve**, not optimise (save "optimise" for technical contexts)

## Words We Avoid

- Synergy, leverage (as a verb), disrupt, pivot
- Best-in-class, world-class, cutting-edge
- Exclamation marks in body copy (reserve for social media, sparingly)
- Rhetorical questions as headings

## Grammar Notes

- **Oxford comma:** Always
- **British spelling:** colour, organisation, analyse, behaviour
- **Sentence case** for headings (not Title Case)
- **Active voice** preferred (aim for >85% active)
- **Numbers:** spell out one to nine, use digits for 10+
