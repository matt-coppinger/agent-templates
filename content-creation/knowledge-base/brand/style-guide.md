- **Ellipses:** Three dots with no spaces between (...)
- **Lists:** No full stops at the end of bullet points unless they are complete sentences

### Numbers and Dates

- Spell out one to nine; use digits for 10 and above
- Always use digits for: percentages (5%), money (£10), measurements
- Dates: 15 February 2026 (not February 15, 2026)
- Time: 09:00, 14:30 (24-hour clock) or 9am, 2.30pm
- Currency: £ before the number, no space (£50, not £ 50)
- Percentages: 73%, not 73 per cent (in body copy)

## Formatting

### Headings
- **Sentence case:** "How to improve your content workflow" not "How To Improve Your Content Workflow"
- **No full stops** at the end of headings
- **H1:** Page/article title only (one per piece)
- **H2:** Major sections
- **H3:** Subsections within H2 blocks
- Do not skip heading levels (H1 → H3 without H2)

### Paragraphs
- Maximum four sentences per paragraph for web content
- One idea per paragraph
- Vary paragraph length for visual rhythm

### Links
- Use descriptive link text: "read our style guide" not "click here"
- External links open in a new tab (note this in markdown if relevant)

### Emphasis
- **Bold** for key terms on first use and important phrases
- *Italics* for publication names, foreign words, and gentle emphasis
- NEVER use all caps for emphasis in body copy

## Content Structure

### Blog Posts
1. **Title** (H1) — compelling, includes primary keyword, under 60 characters
2. **Meta description** — 150–155 characters, includes primary keyword, has a CTA
3. **Introduction** — hook the reader in two to three sentences, state the value proposition
4. **Body** — H2 sections with H3 subsections as needed
5. **Conclusion** — summarise key takeaways, include CTA
6. **Word count** — 800–2,500 words depending on topic depth

### Social Media
- **LinkedIn:** Hook in first line (before "see more"), 150–700 words, 3–5 hashtags
- **Twitter/X:** Under 280 characters per post, 1–3 hashtags, threads for longer content
- **General:** One clear message per post, one CTA maximum

### Email
- **Subject line:** Under 50 characters, no clickbait, clear value
- **Preview text:** Complements (not repeats) the subject line, under 90 characters
- **Body:** Scannable, under 800 words, one primary CTA
- **Sign-off:** Consistent with brand voice (warm but professional)

## Accessibility

- Alt text for all images (descriptive, not decorative)
- Sufficient colour contrast (note in design briefs)
- Avoid directional language ("see the image on the right")
- Use descriptive link text (not "click here" or "read more")
- Structure content with proper heading hierarchy for screen readers
