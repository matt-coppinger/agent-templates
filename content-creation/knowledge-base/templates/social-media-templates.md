# Social Media Content Templates

## LinkedIn Post

```
[Hook — first line visible before "see more". Make it count.]

[Body — 3–5 short paragraphs. One idea per paragraph. Use line breaks for readability.]

[Supporting data point or example.]

[CTA — question, link, or invitation to engage.]

#Hashtag1 #Hashtag2 #Hashtag3
```

### LinkedIn Guidelines
- First line is everything — front-load the value
- 150–700 words optimal
- 3–5 relevant hashtags at the end
- Use line breaks generously (LinkedIn rewards readability)
- Avoid external links in the post body (put in comments if possible)
- Personal angle or "we learned" framing performs well
