CONTENT BRIEF
=============

Title/Topic: How AI is transforming content marketing for mid-size B2B companies

Content type: Blog post
Also repurpose for: LinkedIn, email newsletter teaser

Target audience: Marketing directors and content leads at B2B companies with 50–500 employees. They're under pressure to produce more content with flat budgets and small teams. Technically literate but not AI experts.

Key messages:
1. AI-assisted content workflows can dramatically increase output without growing headcount
2. The key is structured pipelines, not just throwing prompts at a chatbot
3. Brand consistency is achievable with the right guardrails and review process

Tone: Professional-friendly. Knowledgeable but not preachy. We're sharing practical experience, not lecturing.

SEO keywords:
- Primary: "AI content marketing"
- Secondary: "B2B content strategy", "content pipeline automation", "AI marketing tools"

Word count: ~1,200 words (blog), ~300 words (LinkedIn), ~150 words (email teaser)

CTA: Download our free content pipeline template (link: /resources/content-pipeline-template)

Constraints:
- Don't mention specific AI tool names (keep it vendor-neutral)
- Include at least two statistics with sources
- Avoid the "AI will replace writers" narrative — frame as augmentation

Deadline: 20 February 2026
