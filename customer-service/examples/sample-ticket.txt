Subject: DUPLICATE CHARGE - URGENT

Hi,

I've just checked my bank statement and I've been charged TWICE for my February subscription - £49.99 each time. That's nearly £100 taken from my account that shouldn't have been.

This is the second time I've had billing issues with you. Last time it took THREE WEEKS to get a refund. I really don't want to have to chase this again.

If this isn't sorted quickly I'm going to have to look at switching to another provider. I've already seen several people on Twitter complaining about the same thing.

My account number is ACC-7291034.
