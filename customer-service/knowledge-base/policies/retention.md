# Customer Retention Policy

## Churn Risk Indicators
- Customer mentions switching/cancelling
- Repeat contact about same issue
- Social media complaint threat

## Retention Actions
- Acknowledge previous poor experience explicitly
- Expedite resolution (priority processing)
- For repeat issues: offer one month free as goodwill gesture (requires manager approval)
- For social media threats: do NOT reference social media in response, just resolve fast

## Escalation
- 3+ contacts about same issue: auto-escalate to team lead
- Legal threats: escalate to legal team immediately
